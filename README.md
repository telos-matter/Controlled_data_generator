# Controlled data generator ![DEVELOPMENT STATUS: working version](https://badgen.net/badge/DEVELOPMENT%20STATUS/working%20version/green)

Generates random yet controlled data for your regression problems.

The whole thing is a single function called `generate` inside the [controlledDataGenerator.py](controlledDataGenerator.py) file.\
Unlike the [make_regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html) function from the `sklearn` library, this function allows you to define the intervals in which your features should lay as well as how the target should be computed from the features.

### Example:
Check out the [example.py](example.py) file for a quick example.

### Features / options:
Read the documentation of the function.

### Requirements:
- A working PC (can't be a work computer)
- Hands to type with on the keyboard
- Some basic `python` knowledge
- Knowledge on how to quit `Vim`
- Knowledge about **all** the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann-Zeta function
- Latest `numpy` version
